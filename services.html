<h3>E Waste</h3><br>
<p>Not every e-waste needs to be destructed either. Study shows that 63% of e-garbage’s can safely be recycled and this way we can not only show our care to the environment but also can save significant amount of our budget. However, the same study shows that only 17% electronic recycling is done, with the situation being much worse in 3rd world countries including India. EWRI is determined to change this scenario. Our easy and inexpensive plans will help you get rid of all those machines, stacked up in your home or office. </p><br>
<h2>Toner Cartridge Recycling</h2><br>
<p>Printer cartridge or toner is something which comprises almost 12% of total e-waste produced in the whole world. This is much bigger than any other component. This is why EWRI places special importance on toner cartridge recycling. Our dedicated division on toner cartridge allows you to save significant amount. Toner cartridges refilling can easily be done and thus not only we totally recycle and save up to 70% of your costs but it comes with no harm to the environment. </p>
